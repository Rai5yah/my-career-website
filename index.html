      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am an aspiring illustrative novelist, combining storytelling and art to create vivid, emotional worlds. Inspired by books, culture, and folklore, I develop characters and stories that explore both fantasy and real human emotions. Through my work, I aim to connect with others by sharing meaningful stories that celebrate imperfection and imagination. This creative journey is both my passion and my purpose.
